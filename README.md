Glicko Rating System ⚖️

A web-based competitive rating system using the Glicko algorithm

🧠 Overview

This project is an implementation of the Glicko Rating System, designed to evaluate player skill in a competitive environment more accurately than traditional Elo-based systems.

Unlike Elo, Glicko incorporates rating deviation (RD) to represent uncertainty in a player’s rating, allowing the system to adapt dynamically as more match data becomes available.

The project provides a complete pipeline:

Player management

Match simulation

Rating updates

Historical tracking
